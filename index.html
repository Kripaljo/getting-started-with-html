    Web and HTML Basics
Use your browser of choice to select HTML documents stored on remote servers.
HTTP is the protocol used by the internet to access the files.
HTML Documents
Form the heart of the web and include text content, markups, references, and links. 
Tags are used to tell the computer EXACTLY how you want the page to be displayed.
The tags define HTML elements. HTML attributes are properties of an element. For example,
the anchor tag is used to create links. There are many tags and other style elements
that can be looked up as needed. It is not expected that they be memorized.

There are a number of basic components to an HTML document but this course will focus
on the body and content.

Hopefully, inline and block elements will become more clear in later sessions.
